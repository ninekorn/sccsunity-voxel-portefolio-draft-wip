# sccsunity-voxel-portefolio-draft-wip
uploading some new work of bringing back to life my old projects one by one and developing new things. all around voxels.

My voxel planet generator revision1-makes use of what i learned from watching Craig Perko's first minecraft tutorial on youtube:

My development on movement inside a chunk-wise area in the scene. This is not an infinite terrain generator:

My development on trying to make compute shaders work with at least receiving the map from the shader but working with creating the vertices on the CPU:

My development on trying to make compute shaders work with receiving the map and the vertexes locations from the shader but to create the vertices on 
the CPU. using 1 script per type of faces (6) and shaders for each face types:

My development on trying to make compute shaders work with receiving the map and the vertexes locations from the shader but to create the vertices on 
the CPU.  using 1 script for all faces and shaders for each face types:

My old development brought back to life, a script called universegen that i based off of watching the tutorial of Sebastian Lague's Procedural Landmass generation 
and successfully making the threadpool work on generating the map/vertices/triangles and using bytes for a very fluid performance for small chunks. Rev1:

My new development on using compute shaders to calculate the map needed for my universe script to create vertices/triangles from a threadpool. Rev2:
