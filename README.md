# sccsunity-voxel-portefolio-draft-wip

developed in Unity 2020.3.42f1 . 

uploading some new work of bringing back to life my old projects one by one and developing new things. all around voxels.

My voxel planet generator revision1-makes use of what i learned from watching Craig Perko's first minecraft tutorial on youtube. basically, every voxels that i code are based off how to do the basics of generating a voxel map and vertices/triangles from Craig Perko's first minecraft tutorial on youtube, the new stuff i developed
myself with a lot of trial and error and headaches. rev4 released and i developed "per frame voxel mesh flat 3d looped" (xyz) solution, that dictate how fast the per frame 3d flat loop has to loop to unqueue the Queues, with manual settings in the inspector currently only, and this revision is much faster than my previous revisions and it's smoother on the cpu to generate a voxel mesh (neighboor chunks checks now fixed and working). more inspector settings for dequeuing iterations options will be coming in my later revisions:

My development on movement inside a chunk-wise area in the scene. This is not an infinite terrain generator and the camera has to be moved through the editor scene to see the chunks spawning clamped to the limits of the area chunk. I built this after watching Sebastian Lagues Procedural Landmass generation and needed to develop a way to do the same thing with voxels instead of created meshes as shown in Sebastian Lague's Procedural Landmass generation. The way i succeeded was to build the maps and vertexes in a threadpool, referenced from sebastian lagues procedural landmass generation tutorial that shows how to use threadstarts to offload work to threads, so that i could offload to the mainthread/uithread the voxel meshes data where meshes can be created. using my development on my homemade vertex/triangle reducer where i didn't build a proper shader yet so in order to see the vertex/triangle reducer in action you have to select Shaded Wireframe in the unity scene display options. sc_terrain.cs:

My development on trying to make compute shaders work with at least receiving the map from the shader but working with creating the vertices on the CPU. Creating the map from the shader referenced from Sebastian Lague's Marching Cubes tutorial and compute shader access and noise, and sebastian lagues procedural landmass terrain generation tutorial. using my development on my homemade vertex/triangle reducer where i didn't build a proper shader yet so in order to see the vertex/triangle reducer in action you have to select Shaded Wireframe in the unity scene display options:

My development on trying to make compute shaders work with receiving the map and that creates the vertexes locations from the shader and outputs for the cpu to build the vertices.. using 2 script per type of faces (12 total scripts) and shaders for each face types with rev1. in rev2 is my development on trying to make compute shaders work with receiving the map and that creates the vertexes locations from the shader and outputs for the cpu to build the vertices. it's the same thing as the above in terms of results, but developed differently in code as i am only using 2 scripts (2 total) for all faces and shaders for each face types::

My new development on building a very basic simple example of a chunk that is constructed using my WIP homemade vertex/triangle reducer, and also creating a second
mesh for the top face by having compute shaders to work on the map and vertex location and face dimensions but constructing the vertices vector3 on the cpu (i failed at trying to use the append method in hlsl to append to a list, so for the moment expect the cpu to work on creating only the vector3 for each vertex). I use the same principles as the above 2 projects for the topface and create it to the scene, and use a second chunk generation system for the gray chunk underneath that uses my vertex triangle reducer.

My old development brought back to life, a script called universegen that i based off of watching the tutorial of Sebastian Lague's Procedural Landmass generation 
and successfully making the threadpool work on generating the map/vertices/triangles and using bytes (as shown in Craig Perkos first and second minecraft tutorial) for a very fluid performance for small chunks. universe Rev1:

My new development on using compute shaders to calculate the map needed for my universe script to create vertices/triangles from a threadpool. Referenced from how sebastian lague did it in his marching cubes tutorial on github and youtube and based off the basics of voxel generation of craig perko's first minecraft tutorial on youtube. But i am currently only building the map in the shader and not the vertex locations yet. universe Rev2:

My old development with a few tweaks. using my old homemade vertex/triangle reducer, i build the faces one after the other and my vertex/triangle reducer gives better results since the arrays of vertices position aren't shared between the functions that build the faces/verts for the chunk. This is a basic example of how to correctly use my homemade vertex/triangle reducer as i never was done in making sure if it was working or not. I have many variations of my vertex/triangle reducer development, but building the
faces one after the other always was the one iteration that gave better results.

My planet generator revision 3 that i brought back to life coming from my sccsunityVR portefolio. Trying to bring back my 1st and 2nd revision also. You can find my sccsunityvr portefolio in the link at the bottom. The perlin noise never worked correctly for my revision 3 if i remember correctly, hence why it's chunks filled with unbroken bytes... Here i developed a custom projectile tracer, that runs in a task per frame and using a projection forward shadow bullet to lerp from the last position to the new position of the bullet. The speed of the projectile/bullet/ray can be adjusted in code. I developed this without using any physics engine and there are no colliders on the bullet/ray and no colliders on the chunk.

My development on breaking cubes in unity3d back in 2016-2017. i started with creating my scripts with names cubicfrac because i wanted to break cubes and only cubes and climb the rope to move to breaking other types of objects later. I then changed my scripts name to fracture and then shatter when i was able to make a random point inside of a cube and link all the triangles to that random point. but never continued development. Now those asset names are picked on the store, so i am reverting back to my first name CubicFrac and releasing my stuff as that scene name instead CubicFrac, although using my old scripts names in my released folder Fracture4/Shatter1/cubicFrac. Don't worry, those scripts are mine, i developed them, and don't know who's on the store that picked my fav names but now i am stuck with cubicfrac but i am happy anyways. I could procedurally name my development the name that i want them to be. i developed this 2016-2017. although i will be continuing development on the three of my development that i developed back then. I might change it to cubiccrack or something. or i will call them sccsfracture and sccscubicfrac and sccsshatter. 2 of them would be named derivatives to what the assets are named in the store simply because of the same name in the scripts, but i assure you that i created them.

I am also halfway there in bringing back my sccsunityVR revision 1 of my VR ik rig character project, that can wield a pickaxe and a breakable voxel planet with fracturable cubic bytes that can also recombine into a bigger mesh after time passes by for draw call reduction. The spawning of fractures upon the pickaxe here is exaggerated so don't stay in the destroyed by area for a while otherwise it's permaspawn procedurally destroying cubes at the destroyed byte location. i will fix this later when i have a chance. Those projects, i have developped them myself, combining multiple assets, in my free time with my creativity and i will provide the references of certain scripts which aren't mine but easily available on unify wiki or/and the stackoverflow forums or/and the unity engine forums. To see the inverse kinematic in action in my projects, i have read/heard and understood the ik asset of a lot of people but not those that i cannot understand. So the ik i learned it pretty much at least from ProgramYourFace - YouTube (broken link) and dogzerx2 (broken link) and the chunk system i learned it from Craig Perko - YouTube.

the pressure was too big to release on the unity store or not, so despite my portefolio not beeing that cleaned up and not having inquired about how to bring this to the store, when i just have too many bugs that users of my projects would complain too much after purchase anyway since this is an incomplete portefolio, i decided to release it here on github, MIT, and from here, maybe i can keep on piling up my development on top of my development to make better revisions in the future. And how could i be selling to the store when i use so many different MIT license anyway. It feels like a troublesome process which i don't have to go through when i am using github for release. A lot of my projects that i have coded and developed are old and/or with commented out discarded trial/error attempts, and most of my projects are blueprints/templates that can be simplified by anyone anyway, and/or improved upon.

thank you for trying my projects. it's far from perfect and it's not without bugs. i am happy if you find my projects inspiring in order for you to do your own work and programs with voxels in unity or not, i deliver my assets to you as per mit license. I will clean my scripts as i go.

I developed other projects in the past in Virtual reality (using the oculus rift cv1) for unity 2017.4.39f1 or 2017.4.40f1 :
